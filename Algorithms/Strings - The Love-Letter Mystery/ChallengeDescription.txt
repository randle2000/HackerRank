James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

He can only reduce the value of a letter by , i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
The letter a may not be reduced any further.
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries. 
The next  lines will each contain a string .

Constraints

 
 length of string  
All characters are lower case English letters, no spaces.

Output Format

A single line containing the number of minimum operations corresponding to each test case.

Sample Input

4
abc
abcba
abcd
cba
Sample Output

2
0
4
2
Explanation

For the first test case, abc -> abb -> aba.
For the second test case, abcba is already a palindromic string.
For the third test case, abcd -> abcc -> abcb -> abca = abca -> abba.
For the fourth test case, cba -> bba -> aba.
