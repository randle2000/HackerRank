Consider two sets of positive integers,  and . We say that a positive integer, , is between sets  and  if the following conditions are satisfied:

All elements in  are factors of .
 is a factor of all elements in .
In other words, some  is between  and  if that value of  satisfies  for every  in  and also satisfies  for every  in . For example, if  and , then our possible  values are  and .

Given  and , find and print the number of integers (i.e., possible 's) that are between the two sets.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of elements in set ) and  (the number of elements in set ). 
The second line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing . 
The third line contains  distinct space-separated integers describing .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the number of integers that are considered to be between  and .

Explanation

There are three  values between  and :

:
All the elements in  evenly divide .
 evenly divides all the elements in .
:
All the elements in  evenly divide .
 evenly divides all the elements in .
:
All the elements in  evenly divide .
 evenly divides all the elements in .
Thus, we print  as our answer.
