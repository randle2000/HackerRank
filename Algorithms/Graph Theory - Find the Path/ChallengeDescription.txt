You are given a table, , with  rows and  columns. The top-left corner of the table has coordinates , and the bottom-right corner has coordinates . The  cell contains integer .

A path in the table is a sequence of cells  such that for each , cell  and cell  share a side.

The weight of the path  is defined by  where  is the weight of the cell .

You must answer  queries. In each query, you are given the coordinates of two cells,  and . You must find and print the minimum possible weight of a path connecting them.

Note: A cell can share sides with at most  other cells. A cell with coordinates  shares sides with , ,  and .

Input Format

The first line contains  space-separated integers,  (the number of rows in ) and  (the number of columns in ), respectively. 
Each of  subsequent lines contains  space-separated integers. The  integer in the  line denotes the value of . 
The next line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of queries. 
Each of the  subsequent lines describes a query in the form of  space-separated integers: , , , and , respectively.

Constraints

For each query:

Output Format

On a new line for each query, print a single integer denoting the minimum possible weight of a path between  and .

Explanation

The input table looks like this:

Initial Table

The first two queries are explained below:

In the first query, we have to find the minimum possible weight of a path connecting  and . Here is one possible path: First Query Path

The total weight of the path is .

In the second query, we have to find the minimum possible weight of a path connecting  and . Here is one possible path: Second Query Path The total weight of the path is .
